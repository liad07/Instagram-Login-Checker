# Instagram Login Checker

This Python script allows you to check the validity of Instagram login credentials (username and password) using Instagram's API. It is intended for educational and personal use only. Please ensure that you use this script responsibly and in accordance with ethical guidelines.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
